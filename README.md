# blink-detection-opencv
Blink detection system using dlib and OpenCV to track eye landmarks and calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for detecting blinks in real-time. This project tracks blinks using a webcam and draws contours around the eyes, providing visual feedback on the number of detected blinks and the current EAR value.
